# **Alive Or Dead**

The game was implemented in Unity using C#. It's just a clone of the Flappy bird game. I took all assets from Unity Assets Store.

## **The game has the following:**
1. **Control from the phone**
2. **Prefabs of enemy**
3. *Prefabs of player*
4. *Ranged and Melee weapons*
5. **First aid Kit**
6. **UI Manager**
